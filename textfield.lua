--- Text field related variables and functions.
...

--- The x position, in pixels, of the text field when it is the child of a sprite. By default 0.
x = 0

--- The y position, in pixels, of the text field when it is the child of a sprite. By default 0.
y = 0

--- The horizontal scale of the text field when it is the child of a sprite. By default 1.
scaleX = 1.0

--- The vertical scale of the text field when it is the child of a sprite. By default 1.
scaleY = 1.0

--- The vertical scale of the text field when it is the child of a sprite. By default 1.
scaleY = 1.0

--- The rotation of the text field, in degrees, when it is the child of a sprite. By default 0.
rotation = 0

--- The alpha of the text field, represented by a number in the range of 0 - 1. An alpha of 0 means the text field is completely transparent; 1 means fully visible. By default 1.
alpha = 1

--- A number value that is multiplied with the red color channel when drawn. By default 1.
redMultiplier = 1

--- A number value that is multiplied with the green color channel when drawn. By default 1.
greenMultiplier = 1

--- A number value that is multiplied with the blue color channel when drawn. By default 1.
blueMultiplier = 1

--- Sets red, green, and blue multipliers based on a hexadecimal RGB value (e.g. 0xFF0000). Write-only.
colorMultiplier = 0xFFFFFF

--- A number value from -255 to 255 that is added to the alpha channel after it is multiplied by alpha. By default 0.
alphaOffset = 0

--- A number value from -255 to 255 that is added to the alpha channel after it is multiplied by redMultiplier. By default 0.
redOffset = 0

--- A number value from -255 to 255 that is added to the alpha channel after it is multiplied by greenMultiplier. By default 0.
greenOffset = 0

--- A number value from -255 to 255 that is added to the alpha channel after it is multiplied by blueMultiplier. By default 0.
blueOffset = 0

--- The blend mode of the text field. By default "normal".
--- Valid blend modes are defined here:
--- <https://airsdk.dev/reference/actionscript/3.0/flash/display/BlendMode.html>
blendMode = "normal"

--- Whether or not the text field was destroyed. Calling `destroy` sets this to true. Read-only.
destroyed = false

--- Returns the bounds of the text field as a Rectangle, relative to itself.
--- <https://airsdk.dev/reference/actionscript/3.0/flash/geom/Rectangle.html>
function getBounds()
end

--- Returns the bounds of the text field as a Rectangle, relative to itself, excluding any strokes on shapes.
--- <https://airsdk.dev/reference/actionscript/3.0/flash/geom/Rectangle.html>
function getRect()
end
